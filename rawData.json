Madison was a native of Montgomery whose life reflected much of the arc of the Black experience in the 20th century. Born outside Montgomery in 1883, his parents were former enslaved people who managed to create their own community outside the city. Madison knew Booker T. Washington, and after graduating college in 1910, he opened several businesses in Montgomery, then became one of the first participants in the Great Migration, settling in New York and earning a law degree from Columbia University. In New York, he built a legal practice and expanded his business opportunities while getting involved with Father Divine, an influential if controversial Black preacher of the 1920s and 30s. When Madison returned to Montgomery in 1944, he had the intent of developing his hometown even further, but wanted to register Black voters to get critical infrastructure into his hometown. For this, Madison drew the wrath of the white establishment. He was arrested and later stripped of his Alabama law license. But after his legal ordeal, upwards of 700 Black voters went to register in Montgomery, the first time that had happened in Jim Crow Alabama. \r\n\r\nThis is also the untold story of the roots of the modern civil rights movement. Madison's voting rights drive drew together many people who would play key roles in the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Madison collaborated with E.D. Nixon, one of the key boycott leaders, in the voting drive. His work inspired Solomon Seay to move to Montgomery and play a key role in the movement. And he helped a seamstress and activist named Rosa Parks register to vote.  \r\n\r\nMadison's story is a tale of how struggles and defeats often hold the seeds of future victories. Thanks to work with the DOT in Nashville, it's also a well-presented story. ",

After determining whether or not it would be safe for her to proceed, Hannah decided to stay for the entirety of the festival, heading back up to Milford again and again for the weekend. \r\n\r\nWhat resulted was an intimate look at an event centered around the passions of the alt-right, the second amendment, and a concealed carry fashion show. The following subscriber-only story met with acclaim from readers on both sides of the issue, with local residents thanking us for \"finally\" highlighting the absurdity of this growing religious movement (although we had covered them here and there for a few years) to the church itself thanking us for the coverage. \r\n\r\nJust before Thanksgiving, the church invited Hannah to come back and interview the pastor himself. He had \"denied national outlets\" in favor of speaking with her one on one. They spoke about his childhood, skateboarding, and the church doctrine for an upcoming series of stories. Pastor Sean Moon then invited Hannah to come back to the church for a wedding service (which took place the Sunday after Thanksgiving, complete with bullet-encrusted crowns for the bride and groom). Hannah was there, and we have an incredible series of photos resulting from that experience. \r\n\r\nWe are now committed to following this church, as well as the plight of former members, for a series to start this month and continue through 2022.

Upon asking a condo association lobbyist about the purpose of the annual condo fees the state of Florida collects, he said that millions of dollars were being diverted every year into the state's general fund where there is no way to track how that money is spent. With the help of Jeffrey Schweer's Gannett's Florida legislature beat reporter, we were able to find out exactly how much money had been diverted each of the past several years, as well as a history of how the practice began. This finding, which had never been reported before, was significant because those funds could have been used for investigating complaints as well as educating condo association members throughout the state on the importance of maintaining their buildings to reduce the chances of further condo collapses. The story ran in several Gannett papers throughout Florida and was also picked up nationally by various media outlets including USA Today and Fox News. The Florida Bar's condo law safety advisory board, formed in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, also included among its recommendations that the state Legislature halt its practice of diverting money from the Florida condo fund (see page 27 of the task force's report).

The reporter used a short video piece to illustrate the humor and enthusiasm the runners maintained amid the extreme winter weather conditions of the day.\r\nSeveral runners had signed up in advance through a gym they belonged to for a “run on your own” charity fundraiser on Valentine’s Day, Sunday, Feb. 14, 2021. They chose Sterling State Park just off Lake Erie in Michigan as their gathering spot, inviting The Monroe News to meet them at the trail entrance and write a feature. \r\nPaula Wethington was the reporter assigned to get a story and photos for the print edition.\r\nThe weather that day was 20 degrees, with wind chill around 12 degrees. This was so cold the runners decided on a much shorter route than they originally planned, but insisted on still doing the event in costume. As the video and article related, there actually was ice fishing taking place in shanties on the frozen lagoon just off camera. \r\nAfter looking through images she got via iPhone at the trail entrance and a bridge that is part of the popular trail, Wethington made title slides in Canva and did the video editing, splicing and voiceover with iMovie.\r\nThis was among the last “on assignment” features that Wethington worked on as a reporter.

The reporter used a short video piece to illustrate the humor and enthusiasm the runners maintained amid the extreme winter weather conditions of the day.\r\nSeveral runners had signed up in advance through a gym they belonged to for a “run on your own” charity fundraiser on Valentine’s Day, Sunday, Feb. 14, 2021. They chose Sterling State Park just off Lake Erie in Michigan as their gathering spot, inviting The Monroe News to meet them at the trail entrance and write a feature. \r\nPaula Wethington was the reporter assigned to get a story and photos for the print edition.\r\nThe weather that day was 20 degrees, with wind chill around 12 degrees. This was so cold the runners decided on a much shorter route than they originally planned, but insisted on still doing the event in costume. As the video and article related, there actually was ice fishing taking place in shanties on the frozen lagoon just off camera. \r\nAfter looking through images she got via iPhone at the trail entrance and a bridge that is part of the popular trail, Wethington made title slides in Canva and did the video editing, splicing and voiceover with iMovie.\r\nThis was among the last “on assignment” features that Wethington worked on as a reporter. She has since taken a job as a digital producer for the Gannett Michigan Web Team.\r\n",

Berns says the city would run entirely on blockchain technology, while generating billions of dollars in much-needed new revenue for the governor’s unsteady budget. \r\n\r\nFour months and many billable lobbying hours later, the first-term Democrat used part of his State of the State address to sell residents on the idea of “Innovation Zones” — a new, county-like jurisdiction tailor-made for Berns and others seeking to build their own city independent from traditional government oversight. \r\n\r\nThe proposal raised many important questions. \r\n\r\nHow could a company simply assume the role of a local government? And why would Nevada entrust that kind of power to a man like Jeff Berns? And, to that point, just who was is Jeff Berns anyway? \r\n\r\nWhile many national and local outlets focused on the outlandish proposal with just a surface understanding (which included a notable 3-minute monologue by Stephen Colbert) the Reno Gazette Journal saw an major need to dig deep into Berns' and Sisolak's vision, which was still ill-defined and extremely controversial early into the 81st session of the Nevada Legislature. As a result, we started a team investigation, which included trips to a Los Angeles courthouse, interviews with dozens of people and, eventually, a thorough and consequential investigative series. \r\n\r\nThe initial three-part series set out to do three things: Show how Berns used some of the most connected political actors in the state to get his idea into the governor's state of the state address in the middle of a pandemic. We then dug into the fraught business and political relationships that had emerged between Berns and Lance Gilman — a Storey County Commissioner and businessman who oversees the Storey County industrial park that now houses companies like Tesla, Google and Switch, located near Berns' planned \"smart city.\" Last, we dug into Berns' colorful past, telling the story of a businessman who got his start busing the elderly from Southern California to Las Vegas bingo halls to defending clients as a personal injury attorney to running a bawdy telephone dating service that ended in scandal. In the course of our reporting, we would learn Berns and his wife were facing a lawsuit filed by their nanny, accusing the couple of sexual harassment. \r\n\r\nAfter the RGJ series and follow up story about the lawsuit, the proposal ground to a halt in the halls of the Nevada Legislature and instead turned into an interim study for lawmakers. \r\n\r\nIt's for all of these reasons we believe reporters James DeHaven, Jason Hidalgo and Ed Komenda deserve to be recognized for outstanding, and consequential, investigative reporting. \r\n",

Nearly 32,000 structures were threatened, 81 were damaged and more than 1,000 were destroyed. And the Caldor did something only one fire – the almost 1 million-acre Dixie Fire – had ever done. It crested the Sierra Nevada, burning from the western slope onto the eastern slope, forever changing what officials and residents know about predicted wildfire patterns.\r\n\r\nReporter Amy Alonzo and investigations editor Ed Komenda spent weeks working on this 30,000 foot view of the most destructive fire to enter the Lake Tahoe basin in modern history. Alonzo set out to answer three key questions: What happened, what we learned and what needs to happen next. What followed was the most comprehensive analysis of the fire to date, showing just how big a problem the Sierra Nevada will face in the coming years as climate change worsens and human activity threatens ecosystems and communities in ways we never thought imaginable a generation ago. \r\n\r\nThis project showcases the RGJ's strength as a news organization that can go deeper and explain the world in ways other local and national outlets can't when it comes to our region.

As part of a week-long series marking the anniversary of COVID-19's arrival in Northern Nevada, McAndrew told the story that came to define the pandemic: The isolated suffering of people dying from the disease and the helpless family members hoping for a final meeting with their loved one — often to no avail. \r\n\r\nMcAndrew told the story of the Dover family, who lost their matriarch last year.
